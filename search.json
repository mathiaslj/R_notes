The fundamental reason is that human perception primarily judges distances and not areas. Thus, if a data value is encoded entirely as a distance, as is the case with the length of a bar, we perceive it more accurately than when the data value is encoded through a combination of two or more distances that jointly create an area.”\n\nFunctions to change the scale of point sizes (when using aes(size = xx) in a geom_point fx.): - ggplot2::scale_radius can be used to scale based on radius rather than area since. - ggplot2::scale_size_area can be used to make sure ratio of sizes is equal to ratio of data values.\nNote!

    "text": "Color pitfalls\n\nEncoding too much or irrelevant information\n\nToo much:\n\nQuote from reference in title: “As a rule of thumb, qualitative color scales work best when there are three to five different categories that need to be colored. Once we reach eight to ten different categories or more, the task of matching colors to categories becomes too burdensome to be useful, even if the colors remain sufficiently different to be distinguishable in principle.”\nPossible solutions: Label points (potentially color according to a categorisation variable with fewer levels while labelling according to the variable of interest)\n\nIrrelevant: Do not color without a clear purpose that helps answer a question.\n\n\n\nColor vision deficiency\nTip: To make sure your figures work for people with cvd (color-vision-deficiency), don’t just rely on specific color scales. Instead, test your figures in a cvd simulator - See colorspace::deutan\n\n\nColor contrasts\nWe judge color relative to other colors, so colors might appear darker or lighter than they are depending on surrounding colors. See fx. section 1.3.1 from Kieran Healy.\n\n\nColor “scales”\nSee slide 11.\nWorks for categorical variables:\n\nhue: Different colors\n\nWorks for numerical variables:\n\nMake sure to keep hue constant while changing these.\n\n\nchroma: How “saturated” the color is. White, grey, black have no chroma.\nluminance: Darkness/brightness of color. On scale we go from white to black.\n\n\n\nIt’s not only about color\nRedundant coding in essence means we do more than one aesthetic mapping to a single variable. Wilke fx. recommends:\n\n“use color to enhance the visual appearance of the figure without relying entirely on color to convey key information.”\n\n\nScatter plots: Fx. change the shape of points instead of only color.\nLine plots:\n\nChanging line type often does not work very well.\n“If there is a clear visual ordering in your data, make sure to match it in the legend.”.\n\nMost plots will create legend in alphabetical order. Make sure to create factor with levels ordered by magnitude.",

Guideline to almost never do this. If you HAVE to, make a note about it to the reader.\n\nCoumpound figures: “Compound figures consist of separate figure panels assembled in an arbitrary arrangement (which may or may not be grid based) and showing entirely different visualizations, or possibly even different datasets.”\n\nUnlike small multiples, where panels are labelled by variables, labels often need to be added manually to compound figures.
