Once we reach eight to ten different categories or more, the task of matching colors to categories becomes too burdensome to be useful, even if the colors remain sufficiently different to be distinguishable in principle.”\nPossible solutions: Label points (potentially color according to a categorisation variable with fewer levels while labelling according to the variable of interest)\n\nIrrelevant: Do not color without a clear purpose that helps answer a question.\n\n\nTip: To make sure your figures work for people with cvd (color-vision-deficiency), don’t just rely on specific color scales. Instead, test your figures in a cvd simulator.\n\nIt’s not only about color\n\n“use color to enhance the visual appearance of the figure without relying entirely on color to convey key information.” Redundant coding\n\n\nScatter plots: Fx. change the shape of points instead of only color.\nLine plots:\n\nChanging line type often does not work very well.\n“If there is a clear visual ordering in your data, make sure to match it in the legend.”.\n\nMost plots will create legend in alphabetical order.
