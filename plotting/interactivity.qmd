## `plotly`

### `ggplotly`

See [this small document](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/stats787/Current/Notes/Plotly/plotly-notes.html), which describes how to use `plotly::ggplotly`.

> Notice especially the specification of the `text` aesthetic to create new strings in the hover tooltips.

See also the [lab answer](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/stats787/Current/Notes/Plotly/plotly-notes.html) for that weeks lecture.

## [`plotscaper`](https://bartonicek.github.io/plotscaper/)

Create simple linked plots. See this [lab answer](https://mathiaslj.github.io/stats787uoa-data-visualisation/labs/lab7_answer.html#question-2) to lab 7.
