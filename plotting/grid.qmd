title: "`grid` - Creating any graphical object (grob)"
---

The `grid` package allows total customisation in creating *grobs* (graphical objects). They can either be drawn directly using `grid::grid.xx` functions or created as grobs with `grid::xxGrob` functions to be drawn later (with `grid::grid.draw`). This enables us to gather different grobs in a *grob tree* with `grid::gTree` and specifying grobs with a `grid::gList` as the `children` argument (alternatively use `grid::grobTree` when all components are grobs).

### Using viewports

We can use `grid::viewport` with `grid::pushViewport` to draw whatever we want inside a certain area of our "full plotting area" and then go to a parent viewport with `grid::upViewport` (`grid::popViewport` navigates to parent viewport AND deletes the current viewport from the viewport tree).
